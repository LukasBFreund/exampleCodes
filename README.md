# Example Codes
A collection of codes that illustrate different numerical methods etc.

## Numerical Methods
### Linear Time Iteration
I find the linear time iteration method set out in Rendahl (2017) a neat and flexible perturbation-type alternative to Dynare and it's very straightforward to implement. 

Here I illustrate the method by solving the baseline NK model set out in Gali's (2015) textbook, Ch. 3.

### Value Function Iteration

Two codes illustrating how to implement the endogenous gridpoint and envelope condition variants of value function iteration, using a simple stochastic growth model as an example.

### Global Projection

Coming soon, just need to add a few comments.

### Parameterized Expectations Algorithm (PEA)

Coming soon, just need to add a few comments.
