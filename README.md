# Example Codes
A collection of codes that illustrate different numerical methods etc.
## Numerical Methods
### Linear Time Iteration
I find the linear time iteration method set out in Rendahl (2017) a neat and flexible perturbation-type alternative to Dynare and it's very straightforward to implement. 

modelNKGaliCh3LTI.m: illustrates the method by solving the baseline NK model set out in Gali's (2015) textbook, Ch. 3.

### Global Projection

### Parameterized Expectations Algorithm (PEA)
