% EGM_BC.m is a routine for computing current capital satisfying the budget 
% constraint; see  "Envelope Condition Method with an Application to Default 
% Risk Models" by Cristina Arellano, Lilia Maliar, Serguei Maliar and Viktor 
% Tsyrennikov, Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control (2016), 69, 436-459 
% (henceforth, AMMT, 2016).

% Inputs:    "k1" is next-period capital;
%            "k0" is current capital;
%            "c0" is current consumption;
%            "z0" is current productivity;
%            "A" is the normalizing constant in production;
%            %alpha" is the share of capital in production;
%            "delta" is the depreciation rate;
%
% Output:    "dif_BC" is the difference between the right and left hand sides 
%            of the budget constraint
