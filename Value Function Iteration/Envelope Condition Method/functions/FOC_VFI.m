% Inputs:    "k1" is next-period capital;
%            "k0" is current capital;
%            "z0" is current productivity;
%            "A" is the normalizing constant in production;
%            %alpha" is the share of capital in production;
%            "gam" is the utility-function parameter;
%            "delta" is the depreciation rate;
%            "beta" is the discount factor; 
%            "z1" is current level of productivity;
%            "n_nodes" is the integration nodes;
%            "weight_nodes" is the integration weights;
%            "vf" is the vector of polynomial coefficients in the approximated 
%               value function;  
%            "D" is the degree of polynomial approximation
%
% Output:    "dif_FOC" is the difference between the right and left hand 
%            sides of the FOC
